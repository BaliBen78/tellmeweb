Tell-Me-Web (Automating WhatWeb from NMap output)
==================================================
The tell-me-web takes gnmap output (-oG) generated together with -sV option.
It takes all hosts with http & https ports open.
Then it feeds them into whatweb. 

Brendan Coles wrote a similar script in bash which runs whatweb in all ports - https://gist.github.com/798148
